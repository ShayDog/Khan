This is the story all about how my life got twist.
turned up side down and i'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Springfield
In west where-ever born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Springfield."
